# Auto Github Link Checker

The following program will automatically check for a github url to see if it is no longer 404.
You must enter your username and password for it to work on authorized repos.
The program will check the url every three seconds and will open the link on your browser when it is ready.

```
cd gitTest
npm i
open index.js
//enter your username and password
//change the repo_url to whatever you'd like
node index.js
```
